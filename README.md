# HELLO EVERYONE!!!! I AM VAIDEHEE DALVI. I MADE A PROJECT ON EMAIL SPAM FILTERING

# EMAIL SPAM FILTERING
 spam mail classification is normally handled by machine learning (ML) algorithms intended to differentiate between spam and non-spam messages. Machine learning algorithms achieve this by using an automatic and adaptive technique. Rather than depending on hand-coded rules that are susceptible to the perpetually varying characteristics of spam messages, ML methods have the capacity to obtain information from a set of messages provided, and then use the acquired information to classify new messages that it just received.

# AIM OF THE PROJECT
The aim of this project is on the “Email Spam Filtering” it is developed using Python, Jupyter Notebook and some python libraries like Pandas, Pickle, SKlearn, Streamlit etc. This website using Streamlit is very useful which will help you to find whether a Email is spam or ham. We have also added voice recognition feature which will read the message for you after our prediction of the Email.


# PROBLEM DEFINITION
You are probably familiar with what spam emails are already; spam email filtering is an essential feature for email services such as Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and Outlook. Spam emails can be annoying for users, but they bring more issues and risks with them. For example, a spam email can be designed to solicit credit card numbers or bank account information, which can be used for credit card fraud or money laundering. A spam email can also be used to obtain personal data, such as a social security number or user IDs and passwords, which then can be used for identity theft and various other crime


# functions
 In this project the profram classifies the mail as spam and not spam  and filters the mail from inbox this is machinelearning based project.we used libraries like vectorizer pandas numpy multinomialnb in this project. we use ml based speak function.

# CONCLUSION
Conclusion i am able to classify the emails as spam or non-spam(Ham). With high number of emails lots if people using the system it will be difficult to handle all possible mails as our project deals with only limited amount of corpus. Limitations of The Project Following are the limitations of our project: Our project, therefore spam filter is capable of filtering mails according to the domain names listed in black list only.
